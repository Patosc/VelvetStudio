	       >> This version does NOT handle Packed samples. <<

	 >> MIDI support aren't included, but the format handles it. <<



Offs   Byte(s)	Desc

[Header]
0	7	Header: "Extreme"
7	2	Version of format (Hi = MainVer, Low = SubVer eg. 0100 = 1.0)
9	1	cccsssss
		c = Nr of Commands used in tune,
		s = Nr of Sample channels-1 used in tune (0-31)
10	1	Nr of Samples (0-255)
11	2	Nr of Patterns (1-65535)
13	2	Nr of Positions (1-65535)
15	1	Nr of Virtual MIDI channels (0-64)*
16	2	Nr of extra bytes
	x	Virtual MIDI Channel Info.**
	x	Extra bytes for future use.

*  Channels may be duplicated so you can play several notes on the
   same channel, this means that you can have more than 16 MIDI channels.
   (Actually the same amount as the polyphony of the Synth.) Max 64.
** The numbers represents REAL MIDI channels, the position VIRTUAL channels.
   e.g: 0,1,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,7,8,9,9
   That means that you use 10 real MIDI channels, but you play more that one
   note one some. The size of the table is the same as Nr of MIDI Channels


[Sample]
	4	Length Of Sample
	4	Repeat Start for sample
	4	Repeat End for sample
	1	Hi Nibble=PanPosition, Lo Nibble=FineTuneValue
	2	SampleRate for C-2 (normally 8363Hz)
	1	Volume (0-127) MIDI Compatible
	1	Info Byte 76543210  If set to 1:
			  ³³³³³³ÀÁÄ Extra Packed. Compression rate
			  ³³³³³ÀÄÄÄ 16 bit
			  ÀÁÁÁÁÄÄÄÄ Unused

 Data for rest of samples are exactly the same!

[Names]
	1	Length of ModName (max 30 bytes)
	x	ModName
	1	Length of SampName (max 30 bytes)
	x	SampName(s)
	1	Length of ChannelName (max 11 bytes)
	x	ChannelName(s)
	1	Length of PatternName (max 10 bytes)
	x	PatternName(s)
	2	Length of Description (max 65535 bytes)
	x	Description of Module

 The Number of SampleNames are equal to nr of Samples used
 The Number of ChannelNames are equal to nr of Channels used
 The Number of PatternNames are equal to nr of Patterns used

[PatternOrder]
	x	PatternNr. Holds number (0-65535) to tell the tracker what
		pattern to play at that position

[PatternData]
	4	PatternSize (packed)
	x	PatternData

	rppppppp ssssssss rrcccccc bbbbbbbb (uucccccc bbbbbbbb...)

		Legend:
		p	Period. Note 12-108 (C-0 to B-7)
			If 00h -> No note at all. Read next byte as new period.
			If 0ah -> Next byte is the following # of empty rows
		s	SampleNr (0-255)
		r	Nr of commands/note (up to 7)
		c	Command-nr
		b	Command-byte (same as an ordinary .MOD)
		u	Unused

	If a 00h is found. There is no note and no command. Skip that byte
	and read next byte as a new period.
	If a 0ah is found as period, the next byte contains the number of
	following empty rows on the same channel. And therefore the patterns
	are packed channel by channel and not row by row as .MOD.

	(save an empty tune and see how it's done)


[Samples]
	All samples stored after eachother, packed of course.
