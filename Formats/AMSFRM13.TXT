format.

		Legend:
                f       1=Last data chunk on the row.
                p       0=Only Read Period+SampleNr, 1=Only Read Command
                0       Unused
                i       Channel (Samp 0-31, MIDI 0-15)
                e       1=Read one command
                n       Note 12-108 (C-2 to B-9)
                s       SampleNr (0-255)
                r       1=Read one more command
                g       1=Low 6 bits are volume/2
                c       Command-nr
                b       Command-byte

		If g is set, the command only consist of that byte and
		the low 6 bits are assumed to be a volume command. You
		have to multiply the volume by 2 to get the proper value
                (Volume will only be stored this way if it's even)

[Samples]
        All samples stored after eachother, maybe packed with a special packing
        method. Not described here!
