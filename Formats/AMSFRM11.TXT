	 >> MIDI support aren't included, but the format handles it. <<

Offs   Byte(s)	Desc

[Header]
0	7	Header: "Extreme"
7	2	Version of format (Hi = MainVer, Low = SubVer eg. 0100 = 1.0)
9	1	cccsssss
		c = Nr of Commands used in tune,
		s = Nr of Sample channels-1 used in tune (0-31)
10	1	Nr of Samples (0-255)
11	2	Nr of Patterns (1-65535)
13	2	Nr of Positions (1-65535)
15	1	Nr of Virtual MIDI channels (0-64)*
16	2	Nr of extra bytes
	x	Virtual MIDI Channel Info.**
	x	Extra bytes for future use.

*  Channels may be duplicated so you can play several notes on the
   same channel, this means that you can have more than 16 MIDI channels.
   (Actually the same amount as the polyphony of the Synth.) Max 64.
** The numbers represents REAL MIDI channels, the position VIRTUAL channels.
   e.g: 0,1,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,7,8,9,9
   That means that you use 10 real MIDI channels, but you play more that one
   note one some. The size of the table is the same as Nr of MIDI Channels


[Sample]
	4	Length Of Sample
	4	Repeat Start for sample
	4	Repeat End for sample
	1	Hi Nibble=PanPosition, Lo Nibble=FineTuneValue
	2	SampleRate for C-2 (normally 8363Hz)
	1	Volume (0-127) MIDI Compatible
	1	Info Byte 76543210  If set to 1:
			  ³³³³³³ÀÁÄ Packing Method
			  ³ÀÁÁÁÁÄÄÄ Unused
			  ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ 16 bit sample

 Data for rest of samples are exactly the same!

[Names]
	1	Length of ModName (max 30 bytes)
	x	ModName
	1	Length of SampName (max 30 bytes)
	x	SampName(s)
	1	Length of ChannelName (max 11 bytes)
	x	ChannelName(s)
	1	Length of PatternName (max 10 bytes)
	x	PatternName(s)
	2	Length of Description (max 65535 bytes)
	x	Description of Module

 The Number of SampleNames are equal to nr of Samples used
 The Number of ChannelNames are equal to nr of Channels used
 The Number of PatternNames are equal to nr of Patterns used

[PatternOrder]
	x	PatternNr. Holds number (0-65535) to tell the tracker what
		pattern to play at that position

[PatternData]
	4	PatternSize (packed)
	x	PatternData

	eppppppp ssssssss rrcccccc [bbbbbbbb] [ugcccccc bbbbbbbb...]

		Legend:
		e      If 1, the low 7 bits are the following # of empty rows
		p      Period. Note 12-108 (C-0 to B-7)
		s      SampleNr (0-255)
		r      0=No Command 1=1 command, 2=2 Commands
		g      If g=1 then there's another command to read
		c      Command-nr
		b      Command-byte (same as an ordinary .MOD)
		u      Unused

	If e = 1, the low 7 bits contains the number of following empty rows
	on the same channel. Therefore the patterns are packed channel by
	channel and not row by row as in .MOD.

	r contains up to 2 commands. Then you have to read next command to
	see if there are even more commands to read.


[Samples]
	All samples stored after eachother, packed with a special packing
	method not described here!
